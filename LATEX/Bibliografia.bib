In order to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, it is important to properly identify the semantic relationships between the sentiment expressions and the subject. By applying semantic analysis with a syntactic parser and sentiment lexicon, our prototype system achieved high precision (75-95%, depending on the data) in finding sentiments within Web pages and news articles.},

This method is tested on movie reviews, product reviews and MySpace comments. The results show that a hybrid classification can improve the classification effectiveness in terms of micro- and macro-averaged F1. F1 is a measure that takes both the precision and recall of a classifier’s effectiveness into account. In addition, we propose a semi-automatic, complementary approach in which each classifier can contribute to other classifiers to achieve a good level of effectiveness.}

abstract = {Little work to date in sentiment analysis (classifying texts by `positive' or `negative' orientation) has attempted to use fine-grained semantic distinctions in features used for classification. We present a new method for sentiment classification based on extracting and analyzing appraisal groups such as ``very good'' or ``not terribly funny''. An appraisal group is represented as a set of attribute values in several task-independent semantic taxonomies, based on Appraisal Theory. Semi-automated methods were used to build a lexicon of appraising adjectives and their modifiers. We classify movie reviews using features based upon these taxonomies combined with standard ``bag-of-words'' features, and report state-of-the-art accuracy of 90.2%. In addition, we find that some types of appraisal appear to be more significant for sentiment classification than others.},

This paper proposes a novel probabilistic modeling framework based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), called joint sentiment/topic model (JST), which detects sentiment and topic simultaneously from text. Unlike other machine learning approaches to sentiment classification which often require labeled corpora for classifier training, the proposed JST model is fully unsupervised. The model has been evaluated on the movie review dataset to classify the review sentiment polarity and minimum prior information have also been explored to further improve the sentiment classification accuracy. Preliminary experiments have shown promising results achieved by JST.},

abstract = {Several messages express opinions about events, products, and services, political views or even their author's emotional state and mood. Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including analysis of the repercussions of events in social networks, analysis of opinions about products and services, and simply to better understand aspects of social communication in Online Social Networks (OSNs). There are multiple methods for measuring sentiments, including lexical-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods. Despite the wide use and popularity of some methods, it is unclear which method is better for identifying the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) of a message as the current literature does not provide a method of comparison among existing methods. Such a comparison is crucial for understanding the potential limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of popular methods in analyzing the content of OSNs messages. Our study aims at filling this gap by presenting comparisons of eight popular sentiment analysis methods in terms of coverage (i.e., the fraction of messages whose sentiment is identified) and agreement (i.e., the fraction of identified sentiments that are in tune with ground truth). We develop a new method that combines existing approaches, providing the best coverage results and competitive agreement. We also present a free Web service called iFeel, which provides an open API for accessing and comparing results across different sentiment methods for a given text.},

Both travelers and customers find the information in these reviews to be beneficial for their understanding and planning processes. The boom of search engines like Yahoo and Google has flooded users with copious amount of relevant reviews about specific destinations, which is still beyond human comprehension. Sentiment Analysis poses as a powerful tool for users to extract the needful information, as well as to aggregate the collective sentiments of the reviews. Several methods have come to the limelight in recent years for accomplishing this task.

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is a text classification branch, which is defined as the process of extracting sentiment terms (i.e. feature/aspect, or opinion) and determining their opinion semantic orientation. At aspect level, aspect extraction is the core task for sentiment analysis which can either be implicit or explicit aspects. The growth of sentiment analysis has resulted in the emergence of various techniques for both explicit and implicit aspect extraction. However, majority of the research attempts targeted explicit aspect extraction, which indicates that there is a lack of research on implicit aspect extraction. This research provides a review of implicit aspect/features extraction techniques from different perspectives. The first perspective is making a comparison analysis for the techniques available for implicit term extraction with a brief summary of each technique. The second perspective is classifying and comparing the performance, datasets, language used, and shortcomings of the available techniques. In this study, over 50 articles have been reviewed, however, only 45 articles on implicit aspect extraction that span from 2005 to 2016 were analyzed and discussed. Majority of the researchers on implicit aspects extraction rely heavily on unsupervised methods in their research, which makes about 64% of the 45 articles, followed by supervised methods of about 27%, and lastly semi-supervised of 9%. In addition, 25 articles conducted the research work solely on product reviews, and 5 articles conducted their research work using product reviews jointly with other types of data, which makes product review datasets the most frequently used data type compared to other types. Furthermore, research on implicit aspect features extraction has focused on English and Chinese languages compared to other languages. Finally, this review also provides recommendations for future research directions and open problems.}}

Further, annotation tools are also used to extract new information for a particular use case. However, owing to the high number of existing annotation tools, finding the one that best fits particular needs is a demanding task that requires searching the scientific literature followed by installing and trying various tools.We searched for annotation tools and selected a subset of them according to five requirements with which they should comply, such as being Web-based or supporting the definition of a schema. We installed the selected tools (when necessary), carried out hands-on experiments and evaluated them using 26 criteria that covered functional and technical aspects. We defined each criterion on three levels of matches and a score for the final evaluation of the tools.We evaluated 78 tools and selected the following 15 for a detailed evaluation: BioQRator, brat, Catma, Djangology, ezTag, FLAT, LightTag, MAT, MyMiner, PDFAnno, prodigy, tagtog, TextAE, WAT-SL and WebAnno. Full compliance with our 26 criteria ranged from only 9 up to 20 criteria, which demonstrated that some tools are comprehensive and mature enough to be used on most annotation projects. The highest score of 0.81 was obtained by WebAnno (of a maximum value of 1.0).}",

abstract="Virtual Learning Environments are growing in importance as fast as e-learning is becoming highly demanded by universities and students all over the world. This paper investigates how to automatically evaluate User eXperience in this domain. Two Learning Management Systems have been evaluated, one system is an ad-hoc system called ``Conecto'' (in Spanish and English languages), and the other one is an open-source Moodle personalized system (in Spanish). We have applied machine learning tools to all the comments given by a total of 133 users (37 English speakers and 96 Spanish speakers) to obtain their polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) using cross-domain models trained with a corpus of a different domain (tweets for each language) and general models for the language. The obtained results are very promising and they give an insight to keep going the research of applying sentiment analysis tools on User eXperience evaluation. This is a pioneering idea to provide a better and accurate understanding on human needs in the interaction with Virtual Learning Environments. The ultimate goal is to develop further tools of automatic feed-back of user perception for designing Virtual Learning Environments centered in user's emotions, beliefs, preferences, perceptions, responses, behaviors and accomplishments that occur before, during and after the interaction.",

abstractNote={In Open Distance Learning (ODL) institutions the teaching model is moving towards fully integratedinformation andcommunication technology applications. To successfully teach or facilitate the use of technology, academics need to have astrong comfortlevel with the use of technology tools. The academic staff are qualified and experienced subject matter experts but thisdoes not translateto having the necessary technical competencies to do online teaching. They consequently could experience feelings ofincompetency tofacilitate courseware on a technology platform.
The objective of this paper is to identify the factors that influence the user experience when using a Learning management system (LMS) in an academic institution. The research design comprises a convergent, parallel design mixed-method case study. A literature review was conducted to abstract the factors that influence the user experience into a conceptual framework. An expert review was conducted to evaluate the conceptual framework and then a questionnaire-driven survey was performed. The quantitative responses were analysed and the results revealed that eight of the nine factors proposed in the conceptual framework do have an influence on the perceived user experience of the academic when using the LMS. The scope of this paper is the analysis and presentation of the quantitative results of the study.
The contribution of this paper is to present a framework of the factors that influence the user experience of the academic when using a LMS and to improve our understanding of the experience of the academic and the practical challenges involved for academics that have to facilitate learning in an online environment. The findings should be of interest to developers of LMSs and to institutions in support and training of academics that have to use the LMS.},

abstract = {Reviews expressed in e-commerce websites have formed an important source of information for both consumers and enterprises. Text sentiment analysis approaches aim to detect the sentiments of written reviews in order to achieve a better understanding of public opinion towards entities. Aspect-based sentiment analysis deals with capturing sentiments expressed towards each aspect of entities. A common approach in sentiment analysis problems is to take advantage of lexicons to generate features for classification of reviews. Existing aspect-based approaches fail to properly adapt general lexicons to the context of aspect-based datasets which results in reduced performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes extensions of two lexicon generation methods for aspect-based problems; one using statistical methods, and another using a genetic algorithm presented in our previous works. The aforementioned lexicons are then fused with prominent static lexicons to classify the aspects in reviews; this outperforms our previous works according to the t-test results (with a p-value of less than 0.001). Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms baseline methods in aspect-based polarity classification on Bing Liu's customer review datasets and improves precision, recall and F-measure by 6.0, 1.0, and 7.4 percentage points respectively.}

abstract = {Social networking sites have a wealth of user-generated unstructured text for fine-grained sentiment analysis regarding the changing dynamics in the marketplace. In aspect-level sentiment analysis, aspect term extraction (ATE) task identifies the targets of user opinions in the sentence. In the last few years, deep learning approaches significantly improved the performance of aspect extraction. However, the performance of recent models relies on the accuracy of dependency parser and part-of-speech (POS) tagger, which degrades the performance of the system if the sentence doesn't follow the language constraints and the text contains a variety of multi-word aspect-terms. Furthermore, lack of domain and contextual information is again an issue to extract domain-specific, most relevant aspect terms. The existing approaches are not capable of capturing long term dependencies for noun phrases, which in turn fails to extract some valid aspect terms. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-step mixed unsupervised model by combining linguistic patterns with deep learning techniques to improve the ATE task. The first step uses rules-based methods to extract the single word and multi-word aspects, which further prune domain-specific relevant aspects using fine-tuned word embedding. In the second step, the extracted aspects in the first step are used as label data to train the attention-based deep learning model for aspect-term extraction. The experimental evaluation on the SemEval-16 dataset validates our approach as compared to the most recent and baseline techniques.}

abstract="Named entity disambiguation (NED) is the task of linking ambiguous mentions in text to their corresponding entities in a given knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. State-of-the-art NED solutions harness neural networks to generate abstract representations, i.e., embeddings, of mentions and entities, based on which the disambiguation process can be achieved by finding entity with the most similar representation to mention. Nevertheless, the coherence among mentions, and their corresponding entities, is yet neglected. To fill this gap, in this work, we put forward intra, an approach effectively integrating embedding features into a collective disambiguation framework, i.e., probabilistic graphical model. Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling and SampleRank algorithm are implemented for model parameters learning and inference. We evaluate intra on existing dataset against several state-of-the-art NED systems, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

abstract = {Entity Linking (EL) consists of determinating the entities that best represent the mentions in a document. Mentions can be very ambiguous and can refer to different entities in different contexts. In this paper, we present ABACO, a semantic annotation system for Entity Linking (EL) which addresses name ambiguity assuming that the entity that annotates a mention should be coherent with the main topics of the document. ABACO extracts a sub-graph from a knowledge base which interconnects all the candidate entities to annotate each mention in the document. Candidate entities are scored according to their degree of centrality in the knowledge graph and their textual similarity with the topics of the document, and worst candidates are pruned from the sub-graph. The approach has been validated with 13 datasets and compared with other 11 annotation systems using the GERBIL platform. Results show that ABACO outperforms the other systems for medium/large documents.}

Existing studies on the subject were identified, specifying the type of research, its purpose, the use of techniques and method. The literature shows that the concept of CX has different definitions. The purpose of CX is identified as to deliver satisfaction throughout the customer experience that, in turn, leads to brand loyalty and advocacy, but results show there are few publications concerning the subject, especially in the domain of e-learning, and therefore is clear the need to encourage research and academic production.",

abstract="Lately, elearning has been making a comeback not only in business education of global corporations but in academia as well. Offer of classes for masses of population, regardless of time, place or social status, has become a norm in great world centers of learning. One of the most respected MOOC portals, Coursera, joins 138 partners from over 28 countries in its portfolio. Majority of universities offer a comprehensive portfolio of open or paid courses of wide range of specialization, from technical fields to humanities. Rising popularity of this type of education is well documented by the number of students, which reaches 17.5 million [1]. This way, even those whose life circumstances do not allow them to become full-time students can take part in classes. This form of education also enables suitable social conditions for inclusion, which is a welcomed bonus in current situation of population exodus. In the Czech Republic, MOOC projects are among top priorities of the Ministry of Education for 2016 [2]. Design of education systems and applications has undergone distinctive changes lately. Modern technologies, such as mobile and wearable technologies, cloud services and global expansion of the Internet make education accessible for almost anybody and make it largely available. Structure of users and their learning activities expand, which logically brings about a call for better personalization of learning environment. This paper examines what role the user interface plays in the learning process and what requirements on management system the education process reflects.",
